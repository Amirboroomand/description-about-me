# description-about-me
I, Amirhossein Broumand, registered on GitHub on October 5, 2022, but I started programming in Java on September 1, 2019. Until today, I have created several applications in the field of Android and registered several of them in Google Play as a live reference to show my programming level. My intention of creating this account is to connect with the programmers of the world and help them and also help me. My intention is to immigrate to Canada, so I am asking all Java and Android programmers in Canada to help me immigrate to this country. Wishing you health and well-being.
